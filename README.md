# custom-promise-lib
custom-promise-lib is a lightweight JavaScript library recreating native Promise features like .then(), .catch(), .finally(), and static methods (all, race, allSettled). Built for learning, it explores microtasks, closures, state management, chaining, and asynchronous flow through a handsâ€‘on implementation.
